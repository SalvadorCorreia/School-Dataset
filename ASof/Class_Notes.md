### Class Material
Software Arquitecture is the bridge between the requirements and the solutions. We will learn how to **describe requirements** and **design solutions**.

Arquitecture is the "Why" of the code. Code is implemented according to the Arquitecture.

The professor expects a lot of explaining in the project, "the bridge".

The book definition of the Software Arquitecture is: 
> The software architecture of a system is the set of structures needed to reason about the system. These structures comprise software elements, relations among them, and properties of both.

A system has a set of stakeholders (developers, users, business owners, clients, etc.) they define the requirements of the system, we go from arquitecture to design when all requirements are acknowledge by the arquitecture.


Definition: Stakeholders are all parts that define the requirements of a system.
